# dinoGame

My attempt at making Google's Dinosaur Game, in which the player guides a pixelated T-rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. Made using Unity and C#.

To try the game, install and unzip dinoGameInstaller.zip on your PC. Then double-click "Dino Game.exe" to play.
